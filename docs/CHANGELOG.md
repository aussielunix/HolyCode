# Changelog

All notable changes to HolyCode will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.4] - 09/29/2026

### Changed

- Migrate OpenCode to v2 as the scoped `@opencode/cli` package (2.0.18); the legacy `opencode-ai` line is retired
- Simplify the release workflow to build the multi-architecture image and publish it directly to GitHub Container Registry, dropping the Docker Hub, Docker Scout, Trivy, and upgrade/rollback release gates
- Publish the container to GitHub Container Registry only (`ghcr.io/aussielunix/holycode`) and drop the Docker Hub release aliases
- Decouple releases from the `main` branch tip so a fork can bake and publish from any branch or tag while keeping `main` as a clean upstream mirror

### Fixed

- Resolve the OpenCode v2 package rename so the image builds against the published `@opencode/cli` release instead of the retired `opencode-ai` package, and align the npm lifecycle policy and Renovate source accordingly

## [1.2.3] - 09/24/2026

### Added

- Add a v1.2.3 dependency audit covering the selected runtime, CI, owner-scoped, fixture, compatibility-hold, and pending native release gates

### Changed

- Refresh OpenCode to 1.18.32, Claude Code to 2.1.281, OpenSpec to 1.13.2, `opencode-claude-auth` to 2.2.1, npm to 12.1.0, tsx to 4.23.15, pnpm to 12.6.0, Vite to 8.3.1, Prettier to 3.9.9, Lighthouse to 13.5.0, ESLint to 10.11.0, and drizzle-kit to 0.31.11
- Refresh Wrangler to 4.138.0 with its Miniflare 5.20260921.1-alpha and workerd 1.20260921.1 graph, and refresh the Drizzle ORM smoke fixture to 0.45.3
- Refresh the immutable Node 24.21.0 and Go 1.27.1 base-image digests and the protected Renovate validator to 44.112.3
- Keep Paperclip at 2026.831.1 to preserve the self-hosted native-runner default, TypeScript at 6.0.3 for the current API and tsserver contract, Prisma at 7.10.0, json-server at 0.17.4, and the Python lock graph pending the unreleased pip-tools header fix
- Keep issue #11 open: `opencode-claude-auth` 2.2.1 does not establish a fix for the reported proactive credential-refresh failure
- Move the protected release predecessor and rollback image from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2

### Fixed

- Discover models from an enabled external CLIProxyAPI endpoint when no explicit `CLIPROXYAPI_MODELS` allowlist is configured, while keeping explicit lists authoritative and bounding discovery failures

## [1.2.2] - 09/18/2026

### Added

- Add a v1.2.2 dependency audit covering the selected runtime, Python, CI, owner-scoped overrides, compatibility holds, and pending native release gates

### Changed

- Refresh GitHub CLI to 2.101.0, OpenCode to 1.18.31, Claude Code to 2.1.276, OpenSpec to 1.13.1, pnpm to 12.4.2, Prettier to 3.9.8, and Wrangler to 4.134.0 with its Miniflare 5.20260917.0-alpha and workerd 1.20260917.1 graph
- Refresh Playwright to 1.63.0 and pandas to 3.0.6, with compatible clean-resolved updates to contourpy 1.4.0, greenlet 3.5.6, idna 3.20, and urllib3 2.8.0
- Refresh the Node 24.21.0 base image digest, npm-owned brace-expansion to 5.0.12 and ip-address to 10.7.2, and the protected Renovate validator to 44.97.6
- Keep Paperclip at 2026.831.1 because 2026.916.0 enables the native runner by default without a narrow supported self-hosted control that preserves explicit user settings
- Move the protected release predecessor and rollback image from v1.2.0 to v1.2.1

### Fixed

- Reject malformed or cross-scanner Trivy and Docker Scout reports instead of accepting them as empty findings

## [1.2.1] - 09/14/2026

### Added

- Add a v1.2.1 dependency audit with the frozen runtime pins, Python lock-generator boundary, and required native release gates

### Changed

- Refresh Claude Code to 2.1.270, pnpm to 12.4.1, Wrangler to 4.131.2 with its owned Miniflare/workerd pair, fzf to 0.74.4, and lazygit to 0.65.1
- Refresh Matplotlib to 3.11.2, tqdm to 4.70.1, Uvicorn to 0.53.0, and Renovate validation to 44.87.1
- Update the protected release baseline to `v1.2.0` and refresh Debian package resolution for the release preparation date

### Added

- Add a v1.2.0 dependency audit that records the frozen upgrades, compatibility holds, and required release gates

### Changed

- Refresh Node.js to 24.21.0, OpenCode to 1.18.30, Claude Code to 2.1.268, OpenSpec to 1.13.0, Vite to 8.3.0, and Wrangler to 4.131.0
- Keep pnpm 12.4.0 as a provenance-reviewed hold despite npm's `latest` and `latest-12` tags resolving to 12.3.4
- Update the protected release baseline to `v1.1.9` and Renovate validation to 44.79.2
- Refresh the Python dependency lock with FontTools 4.65.0 for Matplotlib

### Fixed

- Replace pip's vendored msgpack copy with the hash-verified 1.2.2 source while keeping it inside pip's vendored namespace

## [1.1.9] - 09/08/2026

### Added

- Copy `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` into the image at `/usr/local/share/holycode/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`
- Validate Paperclip migrations `0223` through `0230`, including account issuer backfills, retired company fields, transient login-session resets, restart persistence, and backup-based rollback

### Changed

- Refresh Go, GitHub CLI, lazygit, OpenCode, Claude Code, Paperclip, OpenSpec, Claude Auth, pnpm, ESLint, Wrangler, NumPy, lxml, and the compatible Python package set
- Keep TypeScript 6.0.3 for its `tsserver` and stable API contract, Prisma 7.10.0 and json-server 0.17.4 on stable releases, and Paperclip's Undici replacement on compatible 6.28.1
- Update the protected release baseline to `v1.1.8` and Renovate to 44.69.12

### Fixed

- Replace PM2's nested `js-yaml` with 4.3.2 and Miniflare's nested Sharp stack with Sharp 0.35.4 plus libvips 1.3.3 using exact owner and integrity guards
- Make suspended Hermes and HolyCode-managed oh-my-openagent startup errors version-neutral while preserving the historical v1.1.4 migration marker

## [1.1.8] - 09/01/2026

### Added

- Add OpenSpec 1.11.0 for explicit, offline spec-driven project initialization with OpenCode

### Changed

- Refresh Node.js, Go, GitHub CLI, fzf, lazygit, OpenCode, Claude Code, Paperclip, pnpm, tsx, Vite, Wrangler, Prisma, ESLint, PM2, Trivy, GitHub Actions, and the compatible Python package set
- Replace pip's vulnerable vendored pkg_resources source with checksum-bound setuptools 78.1.1 while retaining pip's supported importlib metadata backend

### Security

- Rebuild GitHub CLI with `golang.org/x/mod` 0.40.0, replace Prisma's vulnerable nested `deepmerge-ts` and `mysql2` packages with 8.0.0 and 3.22.0, and avoid Debian's superseded `python3-setuptools` bootstrap package before native scanner validation

## [1.1.7] - 08/12/2026

### Fixed

- Replace npm's nested `ip-address` 10.2.0 with integrity-verified 10.3.1 and validate the compatible `socks` declaration, installed tree, and npm runtime
- Replace PM2's nested `js-yaml` 4.3.0 with integrity-verified 4.3.1, align PM2's exact dependency declaration, and validate the installed tree and PM2 runtime

### Security

- Run Docker Scout 1.24.0 and Trivy 0.73.0 on both native architectures during manual main-branch validation, then upload commit-bound SBOM and scanner evidence before a release tag is created

## [1.1.6] - 08/11/2026

### Changed

- Refresh Node.js to 24.19.0, GitHub CLI to 2.97.0, fzf to 0.74.2, lazygit to 0.64.0, OpenCode to 1.18.16, Claude Code to 2.1.228, and Claude Auth to 2.1.6
- Refresh pnpm to 11.21.0, tsx to 4.23.12, Vite to 8.2.1, Wrangler to 4.121.0, ESLint to 10.8.1, and the protected Renovate validator to 44.24.2
- Refresh the hash-locked Python set with Playwright 1.62.0, NumPy 2.5.2, Packaging 26.3, setuptools 84.0.0, Markdown 3.10.3, Uvicorn 0.52.1, and pip 26.2.1

### Security

- Run pull-request image builds and smoke tests natively on both AMD64 and ARM64
- Refresh Docker Scout to 1.24.0 and Trivy to 0.73.0 while keeping fixable critical and high findings fail-closed

## [1.1.5] - 08/02/2026

### Changed

- Correct the HolyCode Cloud README copy, move the live hosted link beneath the product headline, and remove internal release-policy text from public documentation
- Rebuild the image with current Debian Trixie security packages

### Fixed

- Download only the named release-evidence artifacts so BuildKit's `.dockerbuild` record cannot break release attachment uploads

### Security

- Upgrade Chromium to Debian Trixie's available 151.0.7922.71 security package and retire the four Chromium exceptions used by v1.1.4
- Require every fixable critical or high scanner finding to fail the release without active exceptions

## [1.1.4] - 07/30/2026

### Added

- Add hash-locked Python requirements and a separately hash-locked offline pip, setuptools, Packaging, and wheel seed for new virtual environments
- Add exact, expiring security-exception records for Chromium fixes that Debian Trixie has not published yet

- Refresh OpenCode to 1.18.9, Claude Code to 2.1.220, Paperclip to 2026.722.0, npm to 12.0.2, pnpm to 11.18.0, ESLint to 10.8.0, Wrangler to 4.115.0, Prisma to 7.9.1, and the protected Renovate validator to 44.2.3
- Refresh pip to 26.2, pandas to 3.0.5, tqdm to 4.70.0, FastAPI to 0.141.1, and Uvicorn to 0.52.0
- Upgrade Paperclip's reviewed nested Undici replacement to 6.28.0 and validate its installed dependency tree
- Rebuild GitHub CLI 2.96.0, fzf 0.74.1, and lazygit 0.63.1 from exact upstream commits with reviewed Go module security updates
- Install `opencode-claude-auth@2.1.5` from an integrity-verified payload included in the image instead of downloading it at container startup

### Removed

- Remove Netlify CLI and `serve` from the image
- Suspend HolyCode-managed oh-my-openagent installation while its current release tree retains unresolved security findings; stop without changes when the legacy flag is enabled, then disable the old active entry once the flag is removed while preserving settings, skills, and cached package data

### Fixed

- Test Paperclip migrations `0136` through `0183`, user membership, agent runtime state, plugin configuration, post-migration connections, restart persistence, and snapshot-only rollback from `v1.1.3`
- Replace npm's bundled `brace-expansion` and `tar` copies with 5.0.8 and 7.5.22 after verifying registry integrity
- Replace pip's vulnerable vendored msgpack and pkg_resources copies with hash-verified msgpack 1.2.1 and pkg_resources from setuptools 80.9.0
- Remove the root npm cache after reviewed lifecycle scripts run so package tarballs and stale dependency metadata do not remain in the final image
- Run protected release validation against the exact `v1.1.3` predecessor image and require the same candidate digest for publication

### Security

- Install Debian Chromium 150.0.7871.181 with its setuid sandbox enabled and record four unavailable `.186` fixes as exact 30-day exceptions
- Require zero unexcepted fixable critical and high findings from Docker Scout and Trivy on AMD64 and ARM64
- Pin `actions/setup-node` v7.0.0 and `docker/login-action` v4.6.0 by commit, bind protected validation to the exact `origin/main` commit, and validate exact scanner exceptions, plugin modes, release evidence, seccomp, workflows, Compose, and Renovate

## [1.1.3] - 07/21/2026

### Changed

- Refresh OpenCode to 1.18.4, Claude Code to 2.1.216, s6-overlay to 3.2.3.2, fzf to 0.74.1, pnpm to 11.15.1, Vite to 8.1.5, Prettier to 3.9.6, Wrangler to 4.112.0, Prisma to 7.9.0, Lighthouse to 13.4.1, and the default `oh-my-openagent` pin to 4.19.0
- Refresh pip to 26.1.2, Requests to 2.34.2, Pillow to 12.3.0, matplotlib to 3.11.1, tqdm to 4.69.0, FastAPI to 0.139.2, Packaging to 26.2, wheel to 0.47.0, and Rich to 15.0.0
- Keep Paperclip at 2026.707.0 while the 2026.720.0 migration chain receives separate persistence testing
- Run Chromium as `opencode` with its sandbox enabled through the shipped constrained seccomp profile
- Install the versioned PostgreSQL 17 client directly so vulnerability scanners do not attribute obsolete APT findings to its empty compatibility metapackage
- Rebuild GitHub CLI 2.96.0 from its exact upstream tag with digest-pinned Go 1.26.5 while the official package still embeds the vulnerable Go 1.26.4 standard library

### Removed

- Temporarily remove bundled Hermes while its release line requires vulnerable dependency pins; preserve existing `/home/opencode/.hermes` data and stop with a migration message when the legacy flag remains enabled
- Remove Vercel CLI, sharp-cli, concurrently, and LHCI because their current dependency trees contain fixable critical or high findings

### Fixed

- Replace Paperclip's vulnerable nested Undici 5.29.0 with Undici 6.27.0, align the installed Connect dependency declaration, and validate the Cursor adapter until Paperclip updates Connect upstream
- Install npm packages with lifecycle scripts disabled, then validate exact version, integrity, architecture, and script bodies before approved scripts run
- Define rollback as restoring untouched pre-upgrade volumes with image `1.1.2` instead of attempting an in-place database downgrade
- Restore the missing historical v1.0.3 changelog entry
- Promote the exact multi-architecture image digest built and scanned by protected validation instead of rebuilding mutable APT layers during publication

### Security

- Block protected releases on every fixable critical or high scanner finding
- Remove duplicate Debian pip/wheel package metadata after installing the fixed Python packages under `/usr/local`
- Remove the fixable `CVE-2026-39822` path from GitHub CLI and verify its source commit, embedded Go toolchain, and runtime version during the image build
- Update GitHub Actions pins and the Renovate validation pin, and add Chromium sandbox and nonblank Playwright screenshot gates
- Read Docker Scout's fixable-finding SARIF directly so scanner terminal-renderer failures cannot mask or manufacture a release-gate result

## [1.1.2] - 07/15/2026

### Added

- Add a deny-by-default npm 12 lifecycle policy that validates each installed package's exact version, script body, architecture, and allow/block decision

### Changed

- Migrate the image to the digest-pinned Node.js 24.18.0 Trixie base with Debian 13.6, Python 3.13.5, npm 12.0.1, and NumPy 2.5.1
- Refresh OpenCode to 1.18.2, Wrangler to 4.111.0, and lazygit to 0.63.1 while retaining Claude Code 2.1.210, Paperclip 2026.707.0, Hermes v2026.7.7.2, TypeScript 6.0.3, and Vercel 54.21.0
- Document that Wrangler's removed `legacy_env` mode is unsupported and that Netlify remains limited to remote build/deploy commands
- Move protected upgrade and rollback validation from `v1.1.0` to the published `v1.1.1` image and immutable manifest digest

### Fixed

- Run Paperclip's architecture-specific embedded PostgreSQL hydration script during the image build so its packaged library symlinks are ready before the service drops privileges
- Install Hermes' exact Packaging 26.0 requirement in `/usr/local` without trying to remove Trixie's dpkg-owned package
- Reclaim BuildKit's duplicate build cache before protected validation pulls the previous release image, preventing GitHub-hosted runners from exhausting disk space during upgrade and rollback checks

### Security

- Verify both architectures with Trivy 0.72.0 and Docker Scout 1.23.1: no fixable critical finding and no detected secret; record all residual high and unfixed critical findings in the release audit
- Confirm the Trixie image does not contain the fixable ImageMagick issue `CVE-2026-56367`; the newer unfixed `CVE-2026-56372` remains recorded in the audit

## [1.1.1] - 07/15/2026

### Changed

- Refresh OpenCode to 1.18.1, Claude Code to 2.1.210, s6-overlay to 3.2.3.1, pnpm to 11.13.0, tsx to 4.23.1, and the default `oh-my-openagent` pin to 4.18.1
- Refresh the immutable Node 24.18.0 Bookworm image digest and rebuild against current Bookworm repositories, including ImageMagick `deb12u12`
- Align Requests 2.33.0, Pillow 12.2.0, and Rich 14.3.3 with the exact dependency set required by Hermes v2026.7.7.2, then enforce `pip check` in the image build and smoke test
- Install Netlify CLI 26.2.0 without its platform-specific local functions binary and support remote build/deploy commands only
- Replace hard-coded upgrade assertions with release inputs and image metadata so validation compares the actual current and rollback images
- Validate Renovate configuration in pull requests and keep dependency updates behind maintainer review

### Removed

- Remove the bundled CLIProxyAPI sidecar and Compose profile while `v7.2.77` contains fixable high-severity Go dependencies; externally managed `CLIPROXYAPI_*` endpoints remain supported
- Remove the Netlify vulnerability exceptions because the affected binaries are no longer shipped

### Security

- Block releases on fixable critical findings and keep per-architecture Trivy, Docker Scout, SBOM, provenance, and secret checks in protected validation

### Fixed

- Register OpenCode, Xvfb, Paperclip, and Hermes through the `user-bundles.d` path required by s6-overlay 3.2.3.1

## [1.1.0] - 07/12/2026

### Changed

- Refresh the Docker runtime to Node.js 24.18.0 LTS with npm 11.16.0 after the full service matrix passed on Node 24
- Refresh OpenCode to 1.17.18, Paperclip to 2026.707.0, Hermes to v2026.7.7.2, CLIProxyAPI to v7.2.71, and the bundled release pins for eza, fzf, pnpm, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Wrangler, Netlify CLI, tqdm, uvicorn, and Claude Code
- Retain Vercel 54.21.0 until authenticated scope/team behavior is proven, TypeScript 6.0.3 for stable toolchain APIs, NumPy 2.4.6 for Bookworm Python 3.11, and stable json-server 0.17.4 instead of its 1.0 beta
- Pin the default plugin packages to `opencode-claude-auth` 2.0.0 and `oh-my-openagent` 4.17.0, with `auto` syncing declared pins and `manual` preserving user versions
- Enforce one-digit release segments: `v1.0.9` rolls to `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.9` to `v1.2.0`, and `v1.9.9` to `v2.0.0`; published `v1.0.10` through `v1.0.13` remain immutable history
- Document Docker tags without the `v` prefix, digest/checksum/action-SHA hardening, per-platform SBOM and provenance attestations, and per-platform vulnerability scans without claiming byte-for-byte reproducibility, zero vulnerabilities, or universal freshness
- Clarify rollback guidance for copied bind mounts when a migration is not backward compatible, including the `1.0.13` Docker image (`v1.0.13` release) as the rollback target

### Fixed

- Run Hermes with the `opencode` user home and XDG paths instead of inheriting `/root`, preventing future dependency-level permission failures
- Keep OpenCode plugin installs on their exact declared versions across fresh, automatic, manual, and disabled startup modes
- Remove root npm download caches from build layers so package examples that resemble credentials are not shipped or scanned as runtime secrets
- Remove unsupported Hermes key-enforcement and reproducibility claims from the public docs

### Fixed

- Keep pull-request validation pointed at Paperclip's current Skills catalog manifest path

## [1.0.12] - 06/21/2026

### Changed

- Include Paperclip's published Skills catalog package in the Docker image until stable Paperclip carries the upstream package-layout fix
- Document the temporary Paperclip Skills catalog compatibility shim across the README, Docker Hub description, Podman guide, translations, and third-party notices

### Fixed

- Stop Paperclip's Skills page from failing on `GET /api/skills/catalog` by providing the catalog manifest at the path stable Paperclip expects
- Add pull-request validation that checks the Paperclip Skills catalog manifest and verifies a non-empty catalog can load from the built image

## [1.0.11] - 06/20/2026

### Changed

- Refresh Paperclip to 2026.618.0
- Document Paperclip's OpenCode home/config paths and the supported Docker update path across the README, Docker Hub description, Podman guide, examples, security notes, and translations

### Fixed

- Start Paperclip with the same `/home/opencode` HOME and XDG paths used by OpenCode so the OpenCode adapter no longer falls back to `/root/.config/opencode`
- Add pull-request validation that starts Paperclip and checks its runtime HOME/XDG environment

## [1.0.10] - 06/18/2026

### Changed

- Refresh the Docker runtime to Node.js 22.23.0 LTS with npm 10.9.8

- Update GitHub Actions checkout/QEMU pins and add read-only permissions to read-only workflow jobs
- Migrate Renovate custom managers from `fileMatch` to `managerFilePatterns`
- Document the supported Docker update path, Hermes API key requirement, and the remaining third-party CLI audit caveat

### Fixed

- Remove the critical npm audit findings produced by the previous Dockerfile npm pin set
- Keep shell and s6 service files on LF endings so Docker images built from Windows checkouts start correctly
- Start Hermes in foreground mode under HolyCode's own s6 supervision
- Start Paperclip with a Docker-reachable bind preset and pre-create embedded Postgres compatibility symlinks

## [1.0.9] - 05/27/2026

- Install Claude Code CLI in the image so the Claude Auth flow has the binary it expects
- Expand the shipped toolset with TypeScript, pnpm, Prisma, Lighthouse, database CLIs, media tools, and Python utility packages
- Add a pull-request validation workflow that builds the image and smoke-checks the OpenCode binary

### Changed

- Refresh the docs, translations, Docker Hub description, and landing page to reflect the new bundled services and the larger 50+ toolset
- Extend the default compose and env examples with Hermes and Paperclip toggles

### Fixed
